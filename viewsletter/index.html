    <h1>Viewsletter #1 - Visualizing Elections</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to Viewsletter, your monthly data visualization newsletter. Each
      issue, we explore different themes to show how thoughtful visualization
      choices can transform data into clear and compelling insights. This month
      we focus on how data visualizations can be used to tell stories about
      elections. From colorful maps to complex graphs, we’ll see how different
      visualization techniques can be used to effectively represent electoral
      data.

      2024 has been a year full of elections. Indonesia, India, UK, France,
      Mexico, Iran, United States, South Africa, Thailand, the European
      Parliament… As the
      <a

        >timeline published by Reuters</a
      >
      shows, most of the world's major democracies — totalling almost half of
      the world’s population — have had or will have general elections until the
      end of the year.

      Every election is different, and such a wide array of countries will
      obviously have different political contexts, electoral systems, and voting
      issues. For example, we take for granted that having an election means
      that there will be a day in which everyone in a country can vote. Well…
      that’s not always the case.

      This heterogeneity also means that there is a huge diversity of data
      visualization problems to tackle. In fact, even for the same election,
      very different techniques can be used to represent the same data. Many of
      those choices are deliberate and guide narratives in a certain,
      intentional way. As an example, the
      <a href="https://wevis-info.translate.goog/election66-report/"
        >Thai website WeVIS did an amazing job mapping different visualization
        choices</a
      >
      of several websites covering the Thai elections. (I suggest using the
      Safari in-browser translation function, as it also translates the text
      labels in images).

    <h2>Empty land doesn’t vote!</h2>

    <p>
      One of the biggest challenges in election coverage is effectively
      representing the proportion of voters for each candidate on traditional
      maps. Standard Mercator projected maps often fall short, particularly in
      areas where population density varies significantly. When vast, sparsely
      populated regions visually dominate the map, they can inadvertently
      suggest an overwhelming support for a candidate, overshadowing densely
      populated areas where the majority of voters actually reside. This creates
      a misleading narrative, highlighting the necessity for alternative
      visualization techniques that more accurately reflect voter distribution.

      In the United Kingdom, the parliamentary electoral system is structured
      around constituencies that are roughly equal in terms of population but
      can differ dramatically in geographic size. This means that while each
      Member of Parliament represents approximately the same number of
      constituents, the physical areas of these constituencies can range from
      very small urban districts to vast rural regions. Furthermore, the UK uses
      a "first past the post" (FPTP) voting system, in which the candidate who
      receives the most votes in a constituency wins the seat, regardless of
      whether they achieve an outright majority. To visualize the election
      results it is important then to represent constituencies consistently
      using the same visual units.

      A similar example of using a grid to represent constituency results can be
      found in
      <a
        href="https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2024/07/08/legislatives-2024-155-circonscriptions-changent-de-couleur-politique_6247852_4355770.html"
        >Le Monde's article about the French legislative election results</a
      >. In this case, a hexagonal grid is used alongside icons that indicate
      whether a constituency has shifted towards a nearby or distant political
      family.

      An example workaround of this issue is
      <a
        href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/uk-general-election/forecast"
        >The Economist’s UK election forecast</a
      >
      maps. In this case, a geographically accurate map of Britain is used, with
      the constituencies colored by the winning party. However, that map is
      layered on top by a set of circles that are in the closest possible
      position of the geometric center of the constituencies. Obviously, in
      denser regions (like London), this results in the circles being not even
      on top of their own constituencies, but the clever circle hover
      interaction that highlights the borders of the respective constituency
      solves this problem by providing a clear connection between circle and
      geographic entity. Interestingly, the article then focuses on specific
      regions, guiding the reader on a more in-depth analysis of the maps.

      The previously mentioned WeVIS article on online coverage of the Thai
      elections provides an interesting comparison between representations of
      results in a map. It divides maps that use the geographic area of
      constituencies and those that use the same visual unit for all
      constituencies. This last category is further divided by the shape of the
      visual unit used (circle, square or diamond).

    <h2>Polls and uncertainty</h2>
    <p>
      When it comes to understanding elections, interpreting poll data and
      communicating uncertainty and possible outcomes is central. However,
      journalistic coverage about polls still falls many times in over
      simplistic conclusions like “Candidate X has an advantage over Y” without
      giving odds to the outcomes, or “Party Z has n% of the votes”, when in
      fact vote shares from polls are ranges, and what is highly probable is
      that the results will fall into those ranges. (For more about this, I
      recommend
      <a
        href="https://www.amazon.com/Signal-Noise-Many-Predictions-Fail-but/dp/0143125087"
        >Nate Silver’s book</a
      >).
    </p>
    <p>
      FiveThirtyEight is usually referred to as a good example when it comes to
      statistical communication. In
      <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/"
        >their article about the US 2024 Presidential Election</a
      >, outcome distribution is central. 100 simulations are performed and then
      arranged horizontally following an electoral vote margin axis. It is easy
      to understand that outcomes resulting from more simulations have bigger
      odds of happening than cases that appear less often.

      with lowest, highest and median outcome results for each party, color hues
      representing probability, an indication of number of MPs needed for
      majority, and a comparison with last election’s results. Instead of
      telling a story around the median result, sometimes mistaken as the most
      probable result, ranges and outcome probabilities are central in this
      visualization.

      An useful exercise that is often overlooked is to compare poll forecasts
      with the actual election results. In the article

        >Which German party is the most unlucky when it comes to election
        dates?</a
      >
      by Datawrapper, a graph for each party shows the difference between
      average forecasted voting share and actual voting share in the following
      election. The graphs are annotated with useful information about events
      that might have contributed to variations in this difference.

    <h3>Change</h3>

      When it comes to visualizing change, it is important to consider both the
      temporal and spatial dimensions. The

        >Público’s coverage of the Portuguese legislative elections</a
      >
      is a good example of this, as it shows how the political landscape has
      evolved over time and across different regions.

      A different example is Bloomberg’s coverage of the French elections, which

        >uses a ternary chart</a

      Bloomberg also focuses on the rise of Reform UK, showing how

    <p>
      Finally, by looking at change from a spatial perspective, it is possible
      to uncover specific regional trends. The
      <a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/05/world/europe/uk-election-results-map-vote-share.html"
        >New York Times coverage of the UK elections</a
      >
      is a richer example, since instead of just showing a general national
      trend, it uncovers specific and very defined regional trends. As Belgium
      is made up of three very different political entities (Flanders, Wallonia
      and Brussels) with separated political parties, it is interesting to note
      that the ones typically more on the left side of the spectrum, Wallonia
      and Brussels, have moved very noticeably to the right, while the
      historically right-wing Flanders has moved to the left, even if not in the
      same degree.

    <h2>More maps!</h2>
    <p>
      There is no question that spatial variables are of huge importance when it
      comes to political identification and voting. In this section I will
      showcase some examples of projects that use maps to tell different
      election stories.

      It is impossible to talk about geography in elections without talking
      about constituency borders. Somewhat overlooked in proportional electoral
      systems (like the Portuguese one), this issue becomes election-defining in
      systems with uninominal electoral circles. The way districts are shaped is
      so determinant to the results of elections that there is an incentive for
      malicious actors to change them for self-benefit. Gerrymandering, or the
      “political manipulation of electoral district boundaries with the intent
      to create undue advantage for a party, group, or socioeconomic class
      within the constituency” is a very important issue, especially in US
      politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best didactic and interactive example I’ve seen to explain the real
      power of gerrymandering is The New York Times’ interactive game

      purpose of maximizing its own election result.
